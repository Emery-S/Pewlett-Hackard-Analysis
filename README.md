### Two additional queries
* A table that takes a look at the number of retires from each department may provide more insight into which department will require extra assistance with their work load and subsequent hiring process.
* A table that lists salary per job title and retiree would help the company determine what the new employees projected salry growth rate might look like and where to adjust salaries based on current and future economic changes.
